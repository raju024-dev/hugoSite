abstract: Electrostatics of Double-channel Bipolar FET using two separate
  channels for electrons and holes has been analyzed numerically using coupled
  Schrodinger-Poisson equations using self-consistent scheme, while effective
  masses and bandgaps of the materials have been calculated using standard
  Density Functional Theory(DFT). Two different materials namely MoS 2 and
  Phosphorene separated by wide-bandgap Hexagonal Boron Nitride ( hBN) are used
  for n-channel and p-channel respectively because of high mobilities in their
  respective channels. CV characteristics under single bias seems almost sum of
  the individual channel capacitances, but under double bias configuration CV
  can be taken as the averages of channel capacitances. Under single bias,
  electron concentration changes significantly but change in hole concentration
  is negligible, but under double bias both electron and hole concentration
  change in the same manner.
