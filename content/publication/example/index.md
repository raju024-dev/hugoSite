abstract: 2D material based XOI FET has been analyzed for
  Capacitance-Voltage(CV) characteristics where MoS2 has been selected to
  represent 2D materials family. Schrodinger and Poisson equations have been
  solved self-consistently including device channel-oxide barrier penetration
  effects using Finite Difference Method. Material properties as well as
  physical dimensions of the device were varied to investigate these effects on
  the CV of the device. In this study, we observed that quantum capacitance
  becomes prominent when a thin channel has lower effective mass. Also, a
  stair-like behavior has been observed in the CV characteristics when a back
  gate voltage is applied. Channel thickness and back gate voltage control
  threshold voltage whereas effective mass and top oxide thickness control
  magnitude of the CV curve.
