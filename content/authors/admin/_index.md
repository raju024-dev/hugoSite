My name is Saddam Hossain Razo. I am serving as a Lecturer at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering(EEE) of Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology(CUET). I completed my B.Sc(Engg) from Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering(EEE) of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology(BUET). I am also doing my M.Sc Program from the department of EEE, CUET.

After completing my B.Sc. I joined Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering of Daffodil International University and served there for 4(four) months as Lecturer. Then I joined Department of EEE, University of Asia Pacific(UAP). I served UAP for five months.

Then I joined CUET and I really like it. More details on my academics are here.

For my MSc thesis I am trying to model Double-Gate and Nanowire Field Effect Transistor based on 2D materials. I will investigate electronic properties using standard DFT calculations and then I'll explore electrostatics and transport characteristics of my novel device. More about my research are here.

I love travelling.
